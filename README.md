###Changing the Music Industry

Stacks upon stacks of CDs, endless voicemails, and thousands of emails: this an average day in college radio. Why are there so many physical albums being sent, most of which get rejected and discarded? And aren’t record and promotional companies sick of non-stop calling and emailing radio stations to get feedback on their artists? These are the questions the makers of loDial seek to solve. loDial is a one-stop-shop for all sides of the college radio industry. It’s a place where radio stations can listen to a sample of an album, request a CD, and give feedback on artists. It’s also a place where record and promotional companies can receive feedback, communicate with the stations they work with, and allow users a first-hand look at the artists they represent before spending money on sending CDs. With artists depending on radio to get their voices heard, it’s time to make the process of reviewing and communicating in the music industry more streamlined. It’s time for loDial.
